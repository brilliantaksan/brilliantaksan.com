    "When I was a kid and people asked my dream job, I'd say \"inventor.\" Not because I understood it - I just liked the idea of making something new. I still kind of feel that way.\nRight now that looks like:\n- building web apps\n- experimenting with startup ideas\n- filming stories\n- sitting with people who need someone to listen"

      "description": "I joined because I was curious about startups and tired of just watching from the outside. Through the fellowship, I worked on building a student marketplace and spent a lot of time actually shipping instead of just talking. I also helped with content and storytelling, which felt natural because I've always liked documenting things. JVA made building feel less intimidating and more playful, and that mattered to me.",

It was also where I realized I didn't just want to tell founder stories, I wanted to build things myself.",
